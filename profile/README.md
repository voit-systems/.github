## Projects
1. [DARTWIC](/DARTWIC) - Data Aquisition for Rocket Testing With Integrated Controls. A modular and scalable framework for aquiring data, preforming controls, and automating tasks from any device or hardware. Frontend GUI requires no coding and is operator focused with easy system view configuration and custom scripting language. Built for testing rocket engines, but can be used in any controls and automation application.
2. [RAPID](/RAPID) - Real-time Access Parallel In-memory Database. A database specifically designed to preform highly in multi-threaded environments, built with controls and automation applications in mind. DARTWIC uses RAPID internally to communicate over 50 million opeations per second between its control and data aquisition threads.
3. CAESAR (PLANNED) - Comand Authority Engine for Sensitive Automated Resources. A algorithm engine planned to integrate with RAPID databases to enable data redundancy and command voting for sensite controls applications where mistakes matter.
4. TAARS (PLANNED) - Telemetry AI Assistant for Remote Systems. An AI assistant designed to integrate with DARTWIC to enable historical diagnostics, real time controls, and automation support. An AI test operator.
